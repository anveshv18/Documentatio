### Index Configuration
- **Main Index & Mapping**

```PUT index
{
   "settings":{
      "index":{
         "number_of_shards":4,
         "number_of_replicas":0,

               }
            }
         }
      }
   },
   "mappings":{
      "doc":{
         "_source":{
            "enabled":true
         },
         "properties":{
            "title":{
               "type":"text",
               "index":"true",
               "store":true,
               "analyzer":"my_analyzer"
            },
            "content":{
               "type":"text",

            },
            "url":{

            "seed":{
               "type":"keyword",
               "index":"true",
               "store":true
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```
**Note:** By Default elastic search able to search 10,000 documents. We need to change the max result limit inorder to fetch the results more than 10,000 and likewise change the max rescore to the result same as results limit. Try to use SCROLL API if you want to display the records more than 10,000 to avoid heap errors. 
```
PUT index/_settings
{
  "index.max_result_window" : "10000000",
  "max_rescore_window": "10000000"
}
```

- **Status Index & Mapping**
```
{
    "settings": {
        "index": {
            "number_of_shards": 10,
            "number_of_replicas": 0,

                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- **Metrics Index & Mapping**
```
{
  "template": "metrics*",
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 1,
      "refresh_interval": "30s"
    },

            "type": "double"
          }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Analyzers
- **Stemmer Analyzer**

This analyzer is used to search the stem words if the exact words cannot find in the index. If you want to search for the keyword **"hike"** and you dont have exact match word in the index the stemmer come into place and fetch the results includes  **"hiking"**.  We are using 'English' language as our default one.

- **Snowball Analyzer**

This analyzer is used to soleve the problem of singular and plural tenses. This analyzer will give the results  regardless of whether we entered **"admission"** or **"admissions"** otherwise the elastic search consider those as different words. 

- **Stop Analyzer**

This analyzer is used mainly to remove the conjunctions (e.g:and,at,in ,but, etc.,) from the search inorder to increase the efficiency of the search and this analyzers helps to remove the illegal terms based on the request (e.g: restrict the term **"skating"** to search). 

- **Synonyms Analyzer**

This analyzer is used to increase the flexibility of search With minimal configuration. Suppose we want to search a keyword "center for computational relativity and gravitation", it looks bit weired and lazy to type this huge keyword and we are defining this keyword as **"ccrg"**. If you enter **"ccrg"** the results related to **"center for computational relativity and gravitation"** will get diplayed. 

- **Whitespace Analyzer**

The whitespace analyzer breaks text into terms whenever it encounters a whitespace character.

Consider the text: ```A new generation of advanced ground-based and space-borne telescopes.``` 

Whitespace analyzer: ```A, new, generation, of, advanced, ground-based, and, space-borne, telescopes.```

Standard analyzer: ```A, new, generation, of, advanced, ground, based, and, space, borne, telescopes```


### Deleting the results 

To delete the records  consider the below indexes main-index & status-index
- Deleting the records by Url with wildcards

```
POST www-some-index/_delete_by_query {
   "query":{
      "wildcard":{
         "url":{
            "value":"https://www.some.edu/apply/about*"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

- main-index results
```

- status-index results
```
{
_index: "status-index",
_type: "status",
_id: "689251e67ed7b7071fbf4196a805cb3fe60d2322e5feaf95baf1f5f5888c86f6",
_score: 1,
_routing: "www.test.edu",
_source: {

status: "FETCHED",
metadata: {
url%2Epath: [

],
hostname: "www.test.edu"
},
nextFetchDate: "2019-01-08T19:05:18.000Z"
}
},
```
In order to delete the results from the index choose the desired result id of the generated results and delete by using that id by running the DELETE API

```
DELETE /main-index/doc/689251e67ed7b7071fbf4196a805cb3fe60d2322e5feaf95baf1f5f5888c86f6
```

Delete the same result as well as in the status-index. You will find same match id in the status-index. If you won't delete in the status-index there may be a chances that crawler refetch that page and index into the main-index

```
DELETE /status-index/status/689251e67ed7b7071fbf4196a805cb3fe60d2322e5feaf95baf1f5f5888c86f6
```

- Deleting the indexes
Let say if we have three indexes main-index, main-status, main-metrics. Delete all indexes by appling  wildcards rather than delteing individual indices.   
```
DELETE main-*
{
  
}
```

- Deleting individual Records
```
POST www-some-index/_delete_by_query
{
    "query" : {
        "terms" : {
            "_id" : 
              [ "43f4bd7c28dee7b6f8cdca2c58b5b2f2aac482cf3a4314c13b22278e486c5ce0",
              "5b1b6630e9523b47829464bfcb0a1aeacf9b1b3f694425da1ceea3b562ac2ff6",
              "3543cc9a68162443f9caf28063c48dd1e1de2ba4c4b718031e1a60304e40c730",
              "a6383fa17e98917d04e89b1f2f9c21b1d3132b5c096bc2a8146e915db37fb2fa" ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Ranking the results 
```
GET www-some-index/_search
{
   "_source": ["title","url"], 
    "query": {
        "function_score": {
           "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "operator": "and", 
      "query": "admissions",
      "fields": ["title","content"]
    }
  },
        "functions": [
              {
                  "filter": { "match": { "title": "admissions" } },
                 
                  "weight": 10
              },
              {
                  "filter": { "match": { "content": "admissions" } },
                  "weight": 5
              },
              {
                  "filter": { "match_phrase": { "url": "https://www.some.edu/admissions/new/schedule-a-visit" } },
                  "weight": 20
              }
          ],
          "max_boost": 42,
          "score_mode": "sum",
          "boost_mode": "multiply",
          "min_score" : 42
        }
    }
}
```
### Tip:
- When using function_score query use `?search_type=dfs_query_then_fetch` if you are not finding relevant results.[More Info](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/relevance-is-broken.html)
- When creating the status index make sure that the refresh interval value match with the crawler **spout.min.delay.queries** value.
- When field type is `keyword` no need to specify the `match_phrase` on query for phrase search even `match` will work and if the field type is `text` then if you want to make it as phrase search then you can use `match_phrase` on query. 

  **E.g.** 
```
Status-Index      Index Refresh Interval      spout.min.delay.queries
www-colleges        0.5s (500ms)                  500ms
www-all             1s                            1000ms       
www-archives        2s                            2000ms
non-public          1.5s (1500ms)                 1500ms	
```

### Useful Queries

### Tips
set the Elastic Search Heap memory is half of the RAM size( 16GB ram === 8GB Heap)

### Test
```
curl -XGET 'https://search-api.swiftype.com/api/v1/public/engines/search.json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "engine_key": "YOUR_ENGINE_KEY",
        "q": "brothers",
        "filters":{"books":{"in_stock":true,"genre":"fiction"}},
        "per_page":5,
        "page":1,
        "fetch_fields":{
          "books":["author","price"]
        },
        "highlight_fields":{
          "books":{"title":{"size":60,"fallback":true}}
        },
        "search_fields":{
          "books":["title"]
        }
      }'
```
